Event-Details
=============

## Getting Your Team Added
If you don't yet have your team added to the Code Michigan organization, see [Matt Graham](https://github.com/mattgraham), he should be walking around somewhere wearing a black GitHub hoodie and crazy bright orange shoes. He can assist you in getting your team added.

## Datasets
The datasets provided by Socrata are available here, https://community.socrata.com/catalog/code-michigan.

## Setting up Git
To setup Git on your computer visit this page, https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git and click the "Download GitHub for Mac/Windows" depending on which system you are on. Once you download and install the app, it will ask you to enter your GitHub credentials and will setup your machine. If you do not have a GitHub account yet, visit http://github.com to signup for free. If you prefer to use the command line, there are insructions on the page for that as well.

## Adding Team Members
The team member that was initially added to the repository has the ability to add additional team members. To do this, click the Settings link in the sidebar of your git repository, click "Collaborators" and then you will be presented with a page to type in the GitHub usernames of those on your team. Once you add them, they will be able to push and pull code to the repository, as well as clone the repository to their machine. The repository will display in their GitHub app as well.

## Git Questions?
If you're new to git, take a quick read through of the basics on this site http://git-scm.com/doc. That should be able to answer most questions you have on getting started. If you have any further questions, find [Matt Graham](https://github.com/mattgraham) and he should be able to help you out.

Happy Coding!
